## 🧩 Overview  

**Parallels Desktop for macOS** is a robust virtualization solution that allows you to run **Windows, Linux, and other operating systems** alongside macOS without rebooting. Ideal for developers, students, and professionals, it combines speed, flexibility, and simplicity in one platform.  

Its signature **Coherence Mode** lets Windows apps behave like native Mac applications — you can drag-and-drop files, copy text, and switch between environments seamlessly. Parallels Desktop provides a reliable platform for testing software, running Windows-exclusive apps, or managing multiple systems at once.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon**, it delivers fast virtualization with minimal overhead. ARM-based Windows 11, Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora, and other OSes run near-native speed. Advanced 3D acceleration and smooth graphics make it suitable for productivity, development, and light gaming.  

Parallels Desktop redefines multitasking on macOS, blending operating systems and workflows for full Mac performance without compromise.
